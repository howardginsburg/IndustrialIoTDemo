# Industrial IoT Demo

This project is a simplification of the [IOT-Edge-For-IIOT](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-edge-for-iiot) sample.  The sample provides a full Purdue Network deployment in Azure and also provides an Azure DevOps component for automation.  This project strips everything down to a single node deployment of IoT Edge with all of the edge modules running there.
